A Small Collection of Python Games.

## TicTacToe
**Tic-tac-toe** (American English), **noughts and crosses** (British English), or **Xs and Os** is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

This Game does not need any python module. Just run the code.
`python tictactoe.py`

## Crag Dice Game
**Crag** is a dice game similar to Yacht and Yahtzee. It is played with three dice. The game is quicker to play than Yahtzee, and in Clement Wood and Gloria Goddard's 1940 Complete Book of Games, it is described as a game that **"shares with Yacht the supremacy among sequence dice-casting games"**.

This Game needs `tabulate` python module. 

`pip install tabulate`

After installing `tabulate` module, just run the code.

`python crag.py`
